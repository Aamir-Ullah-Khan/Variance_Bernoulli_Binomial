        "Variance (Ïƒ2) is a measurement of the spread between numbers in a data set. It measures how far each number in the set is from the mean and is calculated by taking the differences between each number in the set and the mean, squaring the differences (to make them positive) and dividing the sum of the squares by the number of values in the set.   \n",
        "**Standard Deviation Definition**  \n",
        "Standard deviation is a calculation of the dispersion or variation in a set of numbers. If the standard deviation is a small number, it means the data points are close to their average value. If the deviation is large, it means the numbers are spread out, further from the mean or average. \n",
