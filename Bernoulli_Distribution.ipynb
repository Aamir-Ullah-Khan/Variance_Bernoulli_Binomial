        "A Bernouilli distribution is a discrete probability distribution for a Bernouilli trial — a random experiment that has only two outcomes (usually called a “Success” or a “Failure”). For example, the probability of getting a heads (a “success”) while flipping a coin is 0.5. The probability of “failure” is 1 – P (1 minus the probability of success, which also equals 0.5 for a coin toss). It is a special case of the binomial distribution for n = 1. In other words, it is a binomial distribution with a single trial (e.g. a single coin toss).  \n",
